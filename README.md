Program to practice foreign language vocabulary lists or any other word pairs


Welcome to Magistra, which means teacher in Latin.  This program is
designed to help you practice pairs, such as pairs of words from your
native language their corresponding words in a new language.  It can also be used
for pairs like (state, capital city) or other pairs of text.

Installation

Download the .zip file and unzip into a new folder.

Running Magistra, welcome screen

Double click the .jar file to start Magistra.  It will ask for your name, what language you
want to study, and where to start
in that language.  (It uses "language" rather than asking with "pair-list" you want to study.)
It will also ask where you want to store the word lists and your personal data files.
If you leave these fields blank, Magistra will look for them and store them in the new
folder that you put the .jar file in.

Configuration file

Magistra saves the information you enter into the welcome screen so that it is there the next
time you run it.  If you want to store the word lists or your user data in a different place
than the default, you can do so either by entering the locations in the welcome screen or by
putting them in the file config.txt in the same folder as the .jar file.  Here is an example:

Craig
German
1
C:\cygwin\home\zirbel\magistra\pair_lists\
"C:\Documents and Settings\zirbel\My Documents\My Dropbox\Magistra\"

Using Dropbox for the configuration file makes it possible to use Magistra on different
computers and have the same user information on each of them.
